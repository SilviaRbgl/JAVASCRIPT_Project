# JAVASCRIPT PROJECT

Project for **Code Academy Berlin**.

The goal of the project was to create a Website using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX, APIs, JSON. The goal was finding a free API providing a list of entries, use AJAX to make live calls, transform the data in JSON format and display them using DOM manipulation

I used the API of "Breaking Bad" to simulate the persons that you can hire. With the information of the API, I made some filters of my search.

Most styled elements are done with Bootstrap.
